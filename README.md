<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



The dataset contains information on WeRateDogs (@dog_rates). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with an amusing comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always more than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.

In my analysis, trends in the retweets and favorites counts were discovered over time. This trend highlighted periods where there was an increase and decrease in engagement on WeRateDogs's Twitter account.

There is immense growth in the number of retweets and favorites in April and May. The growth continues and peaks in June.

The months that follow experience reduced activity, with a small hike in the counts of retweets and favorites around October.

WeRateDogs Twitter page experiences its lowest interactions in November and December.
